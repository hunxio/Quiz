# Quiz Generator

Quiz Generator is a Python application that will automatically generate 5 random questions (True/False) using Open TriviaDB API.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements.

```bash
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

It is really simple!
Run main(.py) to start the game and answer the questions, there is a total of 5 questions per session.
I have not made an executable(.exe) for this small project, it is not really needed.
Otherwise you can open your terminal and start the game from there, e.g:

```BASH
PS C:\Your\Path\Quiz>python .\main.py
Welcome! Please answer the questions with True or False

Q.1: The character Plum from &quot;No Game No Life&quot; is a girl.
Answer:
```

## Scope

I have done this extremely small project to test some new concepts I learnt following 100 Days of Python on Udemy. Since I am not comfortable with OOP I am testing my progress with small projects done during the course but with some small differences here and there. Of course I am not looking at the course hints so that I try my best to solve problems and find a solution. :)
